## Introduction
The following project intends to model the trajectory of a land-based missile that is on hair-trigger alert from Moscow to Washingtong D.C.

_Hair-trigger alert:_ is a US military policy that enables the rapid launch of nuclear weapons. Missiles on hair-trigger alert are maintained in a ready-for-launch status, staffed by around-the-clock launch crews, and can be airborne in as few as ten minutes.

## Objectives
The expected output of this project is a set of four servers, each of which provide an essential part of the project. Their denomination is as follows:

> Data Retrieval Server




## Toolset
The project is to be developed by making use of C standard.
