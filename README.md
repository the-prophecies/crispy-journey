## Introduction
~~The following project intends to provide a functional endpoint in which a potential user can visualize a map containing worldwide flight routes in real time.~~

~~The need for such a project stems as a desire to function as a real-time alert system with which to calculate the range in which a solar flare can cause interference with the equipment on board of airships currently flying at high altitudes, given their vulnerability to EMP events.~~

~~As a final project, this aims to be a practical demostration of how a series of computers in parallel can be used to obtain an easily scalable product that could potentially be commercialized and expanded upon once completed, without relying on a single, high performance computer to perform the entire process.~~

“Hair-trigger alert”: is a US military policy that enables the rapid launch of nuclear weapons. Missiles on hair-trigger alert are maintained in a ready-for-launch status, staffed by around-the-clock launch crews, and can be airborne in as few as ten minutes.

## Objectives
~~The expected output of this project is a set of four servers, each of which provide an essential part of the project. Their denomination is as follows:~~

~~> Data Retrieval Server~~

~~In charge of obtaining real-time data from the OpenSky Network API, through the use of Python. Will relay said information in a timely manner to the Storage Server, while also keeping copies of recent data points as required for archive purposes.~~

~~> Storage Server~~

~~In charge of storing up-to-date data with PostgreSQL, to be sorted and retrieved as needed by the Processing Server.~~

~~> Processing Server~~

~~In charge of generating map images on demand, based on the request by the Web Server API~~

~~> Web Server~~

~~In charge of displaying map images to the end user through a modern web interface~~

The objective of this project is to model the trajectory of a nuclear missile on alert from Moscow to Washington D.C. and the impact repercussions with the goal of developing a contingency plan to the extent possible.

Our model should be able to:

Predict the trajectory of the missile before it impacts.

Calculate the time it will take to impact.

Predict impact damage.



## Toolset
The project is to be developed by making use of modern Python 3 libraries, including but not limited to:
* [The OpenSky Network API](https://opensky-network.org/) for data collection of near-real time flight information. 
* [Folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium), a wrapper to the [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) JavaScript mapping library. | v. 0.12.1
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) | v. 1.22.3
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) | v. 1.4.2

Additionally, it plans to make use of the following web technologies, on top of the usual development stack:
* [Apache HTTPD](https://httpd.apache.org/)
* [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)
* [PHP](https://www.php.net/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
