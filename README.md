## Introduction
The following project aims to model the trajectory of a parabolic shot between M and W at a distance of 7,816 km, with varying mass and thrust by calculating the drag force in an atmosphere with polar trajectory.

_Hair-trigger alert:_ is a US military policy that enables the rapid launch of nuclear weapons. Missiles on hair-trigger alert are maintained in a ready-for-launch status, staffed by around-the-clock launch crews, and can be airborne in as few as ten minutes.

## Objective
Generate a series of graphs which accurately predict and simulate the trajectory of a missile with the given initial conditions, in order to estimate the time of flight. Additionaly, compose said images into a gif.


## Toolset
The project is to be developed by making use of C standard.
* [ISO C 98](https://www.iso.org/standards.html)
