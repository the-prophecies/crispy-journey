## Introduction
The following project aims to model the trajectory of a parabolic shot between M and W at a distance of 7,816 km, with varying mass and thrust by calculating the drag force in an atmosphere with polar trajectory.

_Hair-trigger alert:_ is a US military policy that enables the rapid launch of nuclear weapons. Missiles on hair-trigger alert are maintained in a ready-for-launch status, staffed by around-the-clock launch crews, and can be airborne in as few as ten minutes.

### Objective
Generate a series of graphs which accurately predict and simulate the trajectory of a missile with the given initial conditions, in order to estimate the time of flight, mass loss affected by the time and distance of flight. Additionaly, compose said images into a gif.


### Toolset
The project is to be developed by making use of C standard.
